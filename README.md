# Project 1 – Disease Progression Prediction

This notebook implements linear regression models (single, paired, multi-feature) using scikit-learn to predict diabetes disease progression. It includes data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Dataset
Built-in diabetes dataset from sklearn.

## Tasks
- Single feature regression
- Paired feature regression
- Multi-feature regression
- Model evaluation (MSE, R²)

## Extra Credit
Comparison with XGBoost model.
